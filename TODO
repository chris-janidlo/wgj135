FIXME:
follow cam has hard limit on how fast it can go, means player stays offscreen when fast enough
not convinced that right click to look behind actually works

TODO:
find asset for player character
	cutesy spaceman, like a Kerbal

add enemies
	probably as sub units of planets
	at least
		pusher
		heat hurter

resource UI

additional planets
	gas giant - mostly hydrogen
	ice giant - mostly methane
	terrestrial planet - mostly silicon
	variants on neutrinos

actual game loop
	player gets resource requirements
	spawns in at origin with ship
	plays level, mines resources, tries to not die
	goes back to ship, tries to dock, and if successful wins the level
	mayyyybe, if there's time to balance additional weapons, give the player a choice of weapon to pick after beating a level, and then repeat from the top	
	otherwise just stick with one level

fix color language:
	find an outliner shader/material for 3D objects
	good things are black with a red outline
	bad things are red with a black outline
	UI is also red with a black outline

if there's time add a 3D map view
