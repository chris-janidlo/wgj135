TODO:
additional planets
	gas giant - mostly hydrogen
	ice giant - mostly methane
	terrestrial planet - mostly silicon
	variants on neutrinos

actual game loop
	player gets resource requirements
	spawns in at origin with ship
	plays level, mines resources, tries to not die
	goes back to ship, tries to dock, and if successful wins the level
	mayyyybe, if there's time to balance additional weapons, give the player a choice of weapon to pick after beating a level, and then repeat from the top	
	otherwise just stick with one level

add stationary enemy encounter
	single cylindrical man that spawns little drones
	spawns drones at certain rate per second up until he hits a maximum drone count
	or spawns drones at same rate if player gets too close
	drones orbit player and deal heat damage on contact
